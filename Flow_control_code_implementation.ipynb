For example, if the weather is raining, someone will choose to use an umbrella.In addition, there are also situations where a person repeats an activity based on certain conditions, such as when eating, where the process of inserting food into the mouth and digesting it occurs repeatedly. Both examples indicate that a condition can affect the actions taken. Although some conditions are out of control, some can be controlled.This is what is called Flow Control."
